Advance MVP Template with Dagger 2, RxAndroid, Retrofit, Realm, Room, LiveData and Unit Testing
====

This project is unmaintained.

For now, I will contribute for [MVVM template][1] project which uses new [Google Architecture Components][2], takes advantage of the power of [ViewModel][5] and [DataBinding][6] (still use [Realm][3], [Dagger 2][4], [Retrofit][7] and [RxJava][8]).
